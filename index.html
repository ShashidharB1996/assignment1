                <h3>Ford Mustang</h3>
                <img src="img/2016-ford-mustang-to-offer-nostalgic-trim-packages-news-car-and-driver-photo-659051-s-original.jpg" alt="Ford mustang"
                    style="width:300px;height:200px;">
                <p>At Rs 65 lakh, the Mustang is priced very close the Audi TT, which is a more agile, sportier and better-built
                    car. The Mustang on the other hand, changes gears slowly, rolls a lot and has quite a few cheap plastic
                    bits. But that’s missing the point. You don’t buy such an icon for finesse or carving corners. You buy
                    one because of the massive engine under the hood, and its ability to cruise effortlessly at high speeds.
                    And of course, if you love the idea of lighting up the rear tyres with just the flex of your right foot
                    (with traction control off, of course), the Mustang does this in spades! It may not be James Bond, but
                    it sure is Rambo with the vocals of Elvis. Truly a great American muscle car.

                <p>Ford is offering the S variant on both petrol and diesel models and both are priced at a premium of Rs 85,000
                    over the Titanium+. In the diesel version, this difference would get you only extra features like the
                    HID headlamps and the sunroof. However, the petrol, in addition to these, also gets you an upgrade to
                    the EcoBoost engine and the six-speed manual gearbox. Add to that the sporty styling and the fantastic
                    driving dynamics, and the EcoSport S makes for a cracking value proposition
